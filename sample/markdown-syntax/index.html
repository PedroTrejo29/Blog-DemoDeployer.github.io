<h4 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-mentored">Why do I want to be mentored?</h4>
<p>Eight years of professional experience and I&rsquo;ve had a handful of impactful mentors.The mentoring I&rsquo;ve taken part of has made me a better technical worker along with a more well rounded person. It&rsquo;s invaluable to see how a <em>professional</em> approaches a problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do they pick apart a task?</li>
<li>What balance is taken between thoughful planning vs. action?</li>
<li>What technical best practices with nuanced knowledge are they applying at the lowest level?</li>
</ul>
<p>Take these smaller details and roll them up into a larger professional plan. This is where I need help.</p>
<h4 id="what-things-do-i-want-help-with">What things do I want help with?</h4>
<p>One word fits like a glove when describing the challenge I&rsquo;m up against. That word being: <strong>unfocused</strong>. The phrase, &ldquo;jack of all trades but a master of none&rdquo; comes to mind. My skillset has breadth that I am proud of but I fear is short sided.</p>
<p>Another battle I&rsquo;m fighting is <strong>finding the right job</strong>. The position in which I thrived the most had variety baked into it. I was a one man reporting team, responsible for all things Power BI and SSRS. This satisified my need for workspace ownership. Technically, I was a SQL Server DBA so I had administrative tasks as well as the permissions to peform the ETL related duties. I truly felt like a full stack Micrsoft Business Intelligence Developer.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why I&rsquo;d leave that position. The short of it is that I was offered significantly more money elsewhere. According to Brent Ozar&rsquo;s Salary Survey, my unicorn job&rsquo;s salary was awfully low. I&rsquo;ve since worked at larger more bureaucratic organizations. Here I fight with red tape to get things done and at times feel pigeon holed to a set of tasks. The upside to changing jobs is that I&rsquo;ve been more exposed to Microsft&rsquo;s cloud tools.</p>
<h4 id="my-goals-as-a-mentee">My goals as a mentee</h4>
<ol>
<li>Identify a skillset to build upon &amp; become a SME in that area</li>
<li>In any job, have influence and ownership in projects outcome</li>
<li><strong>I want to reach the point that I will competently be the mentor.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As a member of my current employer&rsquo;s Data Engineering team my aim is to be a Azure Data Engineer. As an initial step to fulfill this goal I recently passed the DP-203 exam. In general, I&rsquo;m interested to see where this mentoring project could go and how what I&rsquo;ve initially set out to do may change.</p>
